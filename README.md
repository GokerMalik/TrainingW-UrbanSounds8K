# TrainingW-UrbanSounds8K
An AI Algorithm differentiates between sound recordings in 10 different categories.

This algorithm has been built during the "Deep Learning" Boot Camp which was organised within the scope of Aygaz "W-Energy for Equality" program collaboratively by Global AI Hub and Koç Holding A.Ş. The model is trained with the #UrbanSound8K dataset created by Justin Salamon and it differentiates between sound recordings in 10 different categories.

You can find the UrbanSounds8K dataset here:

The codes are written within the Jupyter Notebook.

Due to the size of the data, I avoided for loops in the pre-processing phase and adopted an approach of storing the data in a hard-drive at each step. To have the codes running successfully, the UrbanSound8K folder should be at the same location with the ipynb files.
