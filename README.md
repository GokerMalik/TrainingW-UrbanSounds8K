# TrainingW-UrbanSounds8K
An AI Algorithm differentiates between sound recordings in 10 different categories.

This algorithm has been built during the "Deep Learning" Boot Camp which was organised within the scope of Aygaz "W-Energy for Equality" program collaboratively by Global AI Hub and Koç Holding A.Ş. The model is trained with the #UrbanSound8K dataset created by Justin Salamon and it differentiates between sound recordings in 10 different categories.
